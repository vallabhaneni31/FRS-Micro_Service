## Dashboard Overview

### Admin Dashboard
Admins see a multi-tab interface:
- **Overview**: System health metrics, device statuses, alerts.
- **Users**: Manage user accounts and roles.
- **Operations Console**: Register/configure devices and view facility details.
- **Live Office Intelligence**: Real-time presence monitoring.
- **Accuracy**: Device recognition accuracy logs.
- **Audit Logs**: View a history of user actions and system events.

Use the top tabs or sidebar to switch between sections.

### HR Dashboard
HR users access workforce analytics:
- **Overview**: Attendance summary (present, late, absent), average hours, overtime.
- **Analytics**: Visual charts for trends, comparisons, and patterns.
- **Employee Profiles**: Individual data and performance.
- **Reports**: Export attendance and analytics data.

Charts are interactive; hover for details and use filters to narrow the timeframe.

## Navigating the Interface

### Sidebar & Mobile Nav
- On desktop, the sidebar on the left shows navigation links and the logout button.
- Use the **Scope Selector** at the top of the sidebar to change organizational context (tenant, customer, site).
- On mobile, a collapsible menu contains the same items; tap the hamburger icon to open.
- User info and theme toggle are available in both sidebar and header.

### Scope Selector
Click the dropdown near the user avatar to choose the current tenant/customer/site/unit you’re working within. Changing the scope updates data and permissions throughout the app.

## Common Tasks

   - Use filters (date, user) to find events; you can export logs as needed.
5. **Manage Memberships**:
   - In **Users**, select a user and edit their memberships to adjust scopes and permissions.

### HR Tasks

## Troubleshooting

## Tips & Best Practices
- Log out when finished, especially on shared devices.
- Use the theme toggle for eye comfort (light/dark mode).
- Frequently refresh reports to ensure you have the latest data.
- Request help from your system administrator for account or permission issues.
